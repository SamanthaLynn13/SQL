# Step 1: To view how the dates were entered into the database

SELECT * FROM crime_scene_report LIMIT 5


# Step 2: To find the crime scene report from the police department’s database.

SELECT * FROM crime_scene_report
WHERE date = 20180115
AND type = "murder"
AND city = "SQL City"

Security footage shows that there were 2 witnesses. 
The first witness lives at the last house on "Northwestern Dr". The second witness, named Annabel, lives somewhere on "Franklin Ave".


# Step 3: find the names of the 2 witnesses.
	
This finds the name and id (since the interview data does not include the person’s name, we need their id) 
of the person with the highest address # on the street ‘Northwestern Dr’: 

SELECT id, name, address_street_name, address_number FROM person
WHERE address_street_name LIKE '%Northwestern Dr%'
ORDER BY address_number desc

	Morty Schapiro - 4919 Northwestern Dr
	ID = 14887

	This finds the name and id of Anabel on ‘Franklin Ave’:

SELECT id, name, address_street_name, address_number FROM person
WHERE address_street_name = 'Franklin Ave'
ORDER BY name asc

Annabel Miller - 103 Franklin Ave
ID = 16371

# Step 4: ensure that the id in the person’s table matches the person id in the interview table.

SELECT person.name, interview.person_id
FROM person
JOIN interview
ON person.id = interview.person_id
WHERE person.name = 'Morty Schapiro'

# Step 5: find the transcript text from the interviews of Morty Schapiro and Annabel Miller.

Morty Schapiro’s interview:
	
SELECT transcript text
FROM interview
WHERE person_id = 14887

	Morty: I heard a gunshot and then saw a man run out. He had a "Get Fit Now Gym" bag. The 
membership number on the bag started with "48Z". Only gold members have those bags. The man got into a car with a plate that included "H42W".

Annabel Miller’s interview:

SELECT transcript text
FROM interview
WHERE person_id = 16371

  I saw the murder happen, and I recognized the killer from my gym when I was working out last week on January the 9th.
  
# Step 6: use the interview information to find the membership number

SELECT membership_id, check_in_date
FROM get_fit_now_check_in
WHERE membership_id LIKE '48Z%'
AND check_in_date = 20180109

Two possibilities:
48Z7A
48Z55

# Step 7: use the membership number and gold status to find the members’ names & person ids.

SELECT id, membership_status, name, person_id
FROM get_fit_now_member
WHERE id IN ('48Z7A', '48Z55')
AND membership_status = 'gold'

Jeremy Bowers 67318
Joe Germuska 28819

# Step 8: find any facebook event checkins for possible suspects.

SELECT *
FROM facebook_event_checkin
WHERE person_id IN ('183779', '423327', '664760', '28819', '67318')

Jeremy Bowers checked in to something on the date of the murder, leaving Joe Germuska as the primary suspect. This could also be an alibi. 

# Step 9: So, let’s double check the interview information for the two suspects to see if we are missing anything. 

SELECT *
FROM interview
WHERE person_id IN ('183779', '423327', '664760', '28819', '67318')

We then find a confession that leads us to the real person behind the crime.

MURDERER = Jeremy Bowers

Congrats, you found the murderer! But wait, there's more... If you think you're up for a challenge, try querying the interview transcript 
of the murderer to find the real villain behind this crime. 

# Step 10: find the license  id of the woman with this info 

SELECT *
FROM drivers_license
WHERE height BETWEEN 65 AND 67
AND hair_color = 'red'
AND car_make = 'Tesla'
AND car_model = 'Model S'

# Step 11: find the names, ids, annual income of the women with these license ids.

SELECT person.license_id, person.name, person.ssn, income.annual_income, person.id
FROM person
JOIN income
ON person.ssn = income.ssn
WHERE license_id IN ('202298','291182','918773')

# Step 12: find the person id who went to the SQL Symphony Concert 3 times in 12/2017

SELECT *
FROM facebook_event_checkin
WHERE person_id IN ('78881', '99716')
AND event_name = 'SQL Symphony Concert'
AND date LIKE '201712%'

Brains behind the murder = Miranda Priestly
