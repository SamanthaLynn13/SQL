# For this project, I downloaded a digital media store dataset (chinook), examined the data to define what I would like to know, and 
performed the analysis in SQLiteStudio to answer my questions.

#1. Show the customer's names, IDs, and country for all customers in the USA.

SELECT CustomerId, FirstName, LastName, Country 
FROM chinook.customers
WHERE Country = 'USA'

#2. Show the contact information of customers from Canada.

SELECT LastName, FirstName, Phone, Fax, Email, Country
From chinook.customers
WHERE Country = 'Canada'

#3. Show the employees’ names, titles, who they report to, and the name and email of their direct report. 

SELECT a.EmployeeId, a.LastName, a.FirstName, a.Title, b.ReportsTo, b.LastName, b.FirstName, b.Email
From chinook.employees a
Left JOIN chinook.employees b
ON a.ReportsTo = b.EmployeeId

#4. Find a unique/distinct list of billing cities.

SELECT distinct BillingCity
FROM chinook.invoices
ORDER BY BillingCity asc

#5. Find the total amount spent per customer.

SELECT CustomerId, SUM(Total)
FROM chinook.invoices
GROUP BY CustomerId
ORDER BY CustomerId asc

#6. How many albums does each artist have?

SELECT albs.ArtistId, art.Name AS Artist_Name, COUNT(albs.AlbumId) AS Number_of_Albums
FROM chinook.albums albs
JOIN chinook.artists art
ON albs.ArtistId = art.ArtistId
GROUP BY albs.ArtistId

#7. Which artist has the most albums?

SELECT albs.ArtistId, art.Name AS Artist_Name, COUNT(albs.AlbumId) AS Number_of_Albums
FROM chinook.albums albs
JOIN chinook.artists art
ON albs.ArtistId = art.ArtistId
GROUP BY albs.ArtistId
ORDER BY Number_of_Albums desc

#8. Who was the most recently hired employee?

SELECT EmployeeId, LastName, FirstName, HireDate
FROM chinook.employees
ORDER BY HireDate desc
LIMIT 1

#9. What were the total sales of 2012?

SELECT SUM(Total)
FROM chinook.invoices
WHERE InvoiceDate LIKE '%2012%'

#10. Write a query that includes the purchased track ID, name, and invoice date.

SELECT TrackID, Name, InvoiceDate
FROM chinook.invoice_items items
JOIN chinook.tracks tracks
ON items.TrackId = tracks.TrackId
JOIN chinook.invoices invoices
ON items.InvoiceId = invoices.InvoiceId

#11. What are the total sales of each employee?

SELECT ROUND(SUM(inv.Total)) as ‘Total Sales’, emp.LastName, emp.FirstName, emp.Title
FROM chinook.customers cust
FULL OUTER JOIN chinook.employees emp
ON cust.SupportRepId = emp.EmployeeId
FULL OUTER JOIN chinook.invoices inv
ON cust.CustomerId = inv.CustomerId
GROUP BY emp.EmployeeId

#12. Which employee had the most sales and what was their total sales?

SELECT emp.LastName, emp.FirstName, ROUND(SUM(inv.Total)) as 'Total Sales'
FROM chinook.customers cust
FULL OUTER JOIN chinook.employees emp
ON cust.SupportRepId = emp.EmployeeId
FULL OUTER JOIN chinook.invoices inv
ON cust.CustomerId = inv.CustomerId
GROUP BY emp.EmployeeId
ORDER BY ROUND(SUM(inv.Total)) desc
LIMIT 1

#13. Write a query that shows each track id, artist, and media type.

SELECT tracks.TrackId, media_types.Name AS 'Media_Type', artists.Name as 'Artist_Name'
FROM chinook.tracks tracks
JOIN chinook.media_types media_types
ON tracks.MediaTypeId = media_types.MediaTypeId
JOIN chinook.artists artists
ON tracks.Name = artists.Name
