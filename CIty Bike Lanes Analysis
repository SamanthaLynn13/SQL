# For this project, I used City Bike Lane data from Break Into Tech Certification Course.
# Then I created a table to insert City Bike Lane data into.
# Finally, I performed analytics on the data using SQL - CTEs.

CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.CityBikeLanes (
id integer primary key,
year_installed year not null,
year_updated year not null,
street varchar not null,
width_feet integer not null,
safetyrating integer not null,
protected varchar not null)

# Scenario: Your boss wants a list of all the bike lanes that have an average safety rating of 4.0 or higher. 
She also wants to see the average safety rating for each of those bike lanes, and a label that says "Safe Lane".
Provide these results using a CTE.
