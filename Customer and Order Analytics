#In this SQL, I'm querying a database with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about customer and order data. 

#1. How many orders were placed in January?

SELECT COUNT(orderid)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE length(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID'


#2. How many of those orders were for an iPhone?

SELECT COUNT(Product)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE Product = 'iPhone'


#3. Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February.

SELECT distinct acctnum
FROM BIT_DB.customers cust
INNER JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales Feb
ON cust.order_id=FEB.orderid
WHERE length(orderid) = 6


#4. Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price?

SELECT price, Product FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
ORDER BY price asc LIMIT 1


#5. What is the total revenue for each product sold in January? (Revenue can be calculated using the number of products sold and the price of the products).

SELECT Product, sum(quantity)*price as 'Revenue'
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY product


#6. Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?

SELECT Product, Quantity, sum(quantity)*price as 'Revenue'
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE location = '548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101'
GROUP BY product


#7. How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time in February, and what was the average amount spent for those customers?

SELECT count(distinct cust.acctnum) , AVG(quantity*price)
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales as Feb
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers as cust
ON Feb.orderID = cust.order_id
WHERE Quantity >2
AND length(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID'


#8. Which locations in New York received at least 3 orders in January, and how many orders did they each receive?

SELECT location, COUNT(orderID)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE location LIKE '%NY%'
AND length(orderID) = 6

GROUP BY location
HAVING count(orderID) >=3


#9. How many of each type of headphone were sold in February?

SELECT SUM(Quantity) as quantity, Product
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE product LIKE '%Headphones%'
GROUP BY Product


#10. What was the average amount spent per account in February?

SELECT SUM(quantity*price)/COUNT(cust.acctnum)
FROM BIT_DB.customers as cust
JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales as feb
ON cust.order_id = feb.orderID
WHERE length(order_id) = 6
AND order_id <> 'Order ID'


#11. What was the average quantity of products purchased per account in February?

SELECT SUM(quantity)/COUNT(cust.acctnum)
FROM BIT_DB.customers as cust
JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales as feb
ON cust.order_id = feb.orderID

AND order_id <> 'Order ID'


#12. Which product brought in the most revenue in January and how much revenue did it bring in total?

SELECT SUM(Quantity*price) as 'Revenue', Product
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY product
ORDER BY sum(quantity*price) desc
