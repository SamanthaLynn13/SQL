In this project, I cleaned a database containing patient health information to upload into SQLiteStudio. 
-- All data used is for training purposes and is not subject to HIPAA.

-- First, I familiarized myself with the data in the Healthcare database. I did this using this query:

SELECT *
FROM Healthcare.allergies
LIMIT 1000;

-- Then, I executed this query for each of the 16 tables.

-- I analyzed the healthcare data to identify insights on patient experiences, hospital operations, types of visits, etc.

-- #1 How many encounters did we have in 2019?

Select COUNT(*) 
FROM Healthcare.encounters 
WHERE START >= '2019-01-01 AND START' 
AND START < '2020-01-01';

-- #2 How many distinct patients did we treat in 2019?

Select COUNT(distinct patient)
FROM Healthcare.encounters 
WHERE START >= '2019-01-01 AND START' 
AND START < '2020-01-01';

-- #3 How many inpatient encounters did we have?

Select COUNT(distinct id)
FROM Healthcare.encounters 
WHERE START >= '2019-01-01 AND START' 
AND START < '2020-01-01'
AND ENCOUNTERCLASS = 'inpatient';

-- #4 How many ambulatory encounters did we have?

Select COUNT(distinct id)
FROM Healthcare.encounters 
WHERE START >= '2019-01-01 AND START' 
AND START < '2020-01-01'
AND ENCOUNTERCLASS = 'ambulatory';

-- #5 How many patient encounters did we have that did not require an overnight bed in the hospital?

Select COUNT(distinct id)
FROM Healthcare.encounters 
WHERE START >= '2019-01-01 AND START' 
AND START < '2020-01-01'
AND ENCOUNTERCLASS IN ('ambulatory', 'wellness', 'outpatient', 'urgentcare');

-- #6 How many encounters did we have before the year 2020?

Select COUNT(distinct id)
FROM Healthcare.encounters 
WHERE START < '2020-01-01';

-- #7 How many distinct patients did we treat before the year 2020?

Select COUNT(distinct patient)
FROM Healthcare.encounters 
WHERE START < '2020-01-01';

-- #8 How many distinct encounters classes are documented in the Healthcare.encounters table?

Select COUNT(distinct encounterclass)
FROM Healthcare.encounters 
WHERE START < '2020-01-01';

-- #9 How many inpatient and ambulatory encounters did we have before 2020?

Select COUNT(distinct id)
FROM Healthcare.encounters 
WHERE START < '2020-01-01'
AND encounterclass IN ('inpatient', 'ambulatory');

-- #10 What is our patient mix by gender, race, and ethnicity?

Select gender, COUNT(*) as Number_of_patients
FROM Healthcare.patients
GROUP BY gender;

Select race, COUNT(*) as Number_of_patients
FROM Healthcare.patients
GROUP BY race;

Select ethnicity, COUNT(*) as Number_of_patients
FROM Healthcare.patients
GROUP BY ethnicity;

-- Or, you can examine the statistics within one query output table:

Select gender, race, ethnicity, COUNT(*) as Number_of_patients
FROM Healthcare.patients
GROUP BY gender, race, ethnicity;

-- #11 What is our patient mix by age?

Select id, birthdate, FLOOR(datediff(curdate(), birthdate)/365.25) AS Age_in_years
FROM Healthcare.patients;

-- #12 How many states and zip codes do we treat patients from?

Select distinct state
FROM Healthcare.patients
GROUP BY state;
  --found only 1 state

Select distinct zip, count(*)
FROM Healthcare.patients
GROUP BY zip;
  --found many zip codes missing in the patient data, so for the next question I focused on county

-- #13 Which state, zip, and county do we treat the most patients from?

Select distinct county, count(*)
FROM Healthcare.patients
GROUP BY county
ORDER BY count(*) desc
LIMIT 1;

-- #14 What is our patient mix for patients who had an inpatient encounter in 2019?

Select gender, race, ethnicity, COUNT(*) as Volumes
FROM Healthcare.encounters enc
JOIN Healthcare.patients pat
ON enc.PATIENT = pat.Id
WHERE START >= '2019-01-01 AND START' 
AND START < '2020-01-01'
AND ENCOUNTERCLASS = 'inpatient'
GROUP BY gender, race, ethnicity
ORDER BY Volumes desc;
